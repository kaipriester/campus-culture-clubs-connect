## User Documention

Hello UF Students!

Welcome to Campus Club Culture Connect of 4C. This webapp is a central location to explore student culture clubs on the University of Florida (UF) campus. With the shift to online course work, it has become more difficult for students to make meaningful connections when moving to campus. Also, online environments have amplified cultural discrimination. Cultural clubs are a great way to nurture welcoming communities for all students. 4C is a way for students to find clubs and show them how to get involved in an effective and safe way during the pandemic by utilizing online platforms (Slack, Discord, Groupmeâ€¦).

## Developer Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed/hosted using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/).

### Steps for development set-up
* We recomend using VScode for development (make sure you have git set up and it's easiest to run/commit from the terminal inside of VScode)
* Set up Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/ (this is to run React)
* Clone this repo https://github.com/kaipriester/campus-culture-clubs-connect.git
* Open it in VScode 
* If you have everything configured you should be able to cd into campus-culture-clubs-connect dir and run "npm start"
the page it renders on your local host should look exactly like this web page https://lively-coast-0e7affc0f.1.azurestaticapps.net/
* This is because every time a commit it made to main branch it will redeploy the application through github actions to Azure Static Web Apps hosting (if you are interested on how that works check this out https://blog.leitwolf.io/deploy-react-azure-static-web-app/)
* If you wanna play around with this application, make changes on your own branch and submit a pull request if you would like your changes to be considered
